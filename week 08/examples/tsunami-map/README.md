# Tsunami data with Natural Earth map data

This example demonstrates mapping historical tsunami data from an API to onto map data loaded from [geoJSON](https://github.com/martynafford/natural-earth-geojson) downloaded from the Natural Earth project.

Compare with the [tsunami drawing](../tsunami-drawing) example.
