# Tsunami data with AxiDraw Plotter

This example demonstrates mapping historical tsunami data from an API to movements on a pen plotter, the AxiDraw using the [p5.axidraw library](https://github.com/jmpinit/p5.axidraw).

Compare with the [basic example on the p5.axidraw library Github repo](https://github.com/jmpinit/p5.axidraw/blob/main/examples/basic/sketch.js), and the [tsunami drawing](../tsunami-drawing) example.
