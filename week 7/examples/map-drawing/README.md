# Map Drawing

Using [open map data of New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-digital-city-map.page), this sketch progressively draws a map of New York, centered on Manhattan. Inspired by Ryuji Ikeda's [data-verse](https://www.factmag.com/2021/05/20/ryoji-ikeda-presents-data-verse/).
