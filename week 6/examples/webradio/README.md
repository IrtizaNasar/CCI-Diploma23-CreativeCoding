# Web Radio 

This is a simple get started example for you to get started on your Invisible Radio assignment. 
If you decide to use web radios as part of your project you can play around with this code to integrate different web radio channels.

In this example you can see: 

- How to play different radio channels (NTS)
- How to change the volume
- How to stop the streaming

I'll be showing you how this was made at the beginning of next class (week 7) as we run out of time today.
