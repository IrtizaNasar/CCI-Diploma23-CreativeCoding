## Information

- [All term dates](https://www.arts.ac.uk/students/term-dates)
- Lecturers: Irti (Irtiza Nasar), Kevin Lee, Giulio Ammendola
- Location: [Creative Computing Institute](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute), in person at the Greencoat Building.
- Contact us via the [UAL Creative Computing Institute Slack](https://ual-cci.slack.com).
- Weekly Unit teaching times are every Monday 09:30-13:30.
- _**You are expected to undertake independent study of about 25 hours per week - spread across all the courses you are taking in the Diploma.**_

- [The Library Services Web pages aim to provide quick access to a range of relevant high quality e-resources](https://www.arts.ac.uk/students/library-services). Benelia Salmon is the Academic Support Librarian for CCI: [b.salmon@arts.ac.uk](mailto:b.salmon@arts.ac.uk). Please contact her at the email address above if you have any questions regarding library resources or if you wish to book a one-to-one session on library information and research skills. You can find more information on CCI specific library resources in your [Creative Computing Institute subject guide](https://arts.ac.libguides.com/CCI).
- LinkedIn Learning (formally Lynda.com) is also a great resource for learning software packages, coding or even 3D tools like Blender. You can find a link to LinkedIn Learning on <https://canvas.arts.ac.uk/>.
- <https://wiki.cci.arts.ac.uk/> is the Wiki for all of CCI, lots of resources and tutorial there about equipment, software and content on Physical Computing, Creative Code and Digital Making.

## Block/Term Structure

The [Diploma in Creative Computing](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-creative-computing-institute-diploma) is split into two blocks of teaching. **Block 1** takes up the entire Autumn term and half of the Spring term. **Block 2** follows on, taking the second half of Spring term and the entire Summer term.

**Block 1** consists of three units:

- Unit 1: Creative Coding: Methods and Frameworks
- Unit 2: Computational Futures, AI and Machine Learning
- Unit 3: Creative Practice: Visual Coding and Physical Computing

**Block 2** consists of three units:

- Unit 4: Coding for Collaborative App Development
- Unit 5: Work and the Digital Creative Industries
- Unit 6: Creative Practice: Computational Environments

## Learning Outcomes and platforms for doing so

Please read [UAL's guidance for students on how they will be assessed](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment). [TLDR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TLDR): you will be assessed on the following 5 assessment criteria (quoting from [UAL's page](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment):

1. **Enquiry**
   - Enquiry is about active learning and reflection. It’s how you explore, research and learn about your subject. Enquiry is central to all creative learning at UAL.
2. **Knowledge**
   - Knowledge is about gathering information and enhancing understanding. It’s how you inform your work, explore diverse cultures and connections and appreciate what you do in a wider context.
3. **Process**
   - Process is about your journey of learning. It’s how you take risks and experiment. And how you keep the creative momentum going — developing ideas from start to finish.
4. **Communication**
   - Communication is about telling the story of your learning and making. It’s how you share your learning with an audience, presenting and explaining your work to different people.
5. **Realisation**
   - Realisation is about the work you create and how this reveals what you’ve learned. It’s taking a look back and evaluating the work you’ve produced.

N.B. The Diploma is assessed to [Level 5 Assessment Criteria Descriptors](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment) - see the link to the PDF at the bottom of this page.

<!-- At the end of this block (midway through the 2022 Spring term) you should have the following outcomes, with subheadings for methods and platforms we will use to do so. To be clear, I want you to obtain knowledge and then use that to make projects. My aim is to have every student graduate with new creative computing core knowledge and a portfolio of projects that relate that new creative computing knowledge to their chosen BA subject elsewhere at University of the Arts London (UAL). -->

### Unit 1 / Block 1: "Creative Coding: Methods and Frameworks"

1. Demonstrate computational problem-solving skills (_Knowledge_, _Process_)

<!-- - [JavaScript](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) -->
<!-- - [C++](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) -->

2. Demonstrate an understanding of core programming principles including variables,
   loops conditional statements, arrays, and functions (_Knowledge_, _Realisation_)

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
<!-- - [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) -->

3. Demonstrate the ability to develop your work in a broader conceptual and theoretical
   context (_Enquiry_, _Communication_)

<!-- - [Slack](https://slack.com/)
- [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
-->

4. Demonstrate an understanding and use of industry standards of software
   development, version control and collaborative working practices (_Knowledge_, _Process_, _Communication_)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Assessment

<!-- At the end of Block 1 (halfway through the Spring Term) and at the end of Block 2 (at the end of the Summer Term), you will be assessed individually. The two units I teach (Unit 1 and Unit 4) are assessed in the same way, via multiple choice test and practical exam. Each part is worth 50% of the unit mark. In the multiple choice test you will be presented with a 20 questions relating explicitly to course content. You must choose between up to 4 potentially correct answers per question. You will be given 1 hour to complete the 20 multiple choice questions. In the Practical Exam you will be individually asked to write a basic program to demonstrate the application of creative coding to a set problem. You will be given 2 hours to complete the Practical Exam. -->
